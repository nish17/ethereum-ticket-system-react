address the error: un implemented  feature : nested arrays not yet implemented

Evaluation: read / write delay wrt to the number of commuters purchasing tickets
and number of ongoing trips will be assessed using the rinkby testnet


route description will be the list of bus-stops
every trip will report its arrival time at every bus-stop

if a trip has reported its arrival at more than 80% of the bus-stops, it will  be
eligible for the completion

this will take care of the issue when the bus-operator does not complete the trip
